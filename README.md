This repository contains scripts to find coordination environments of interest.  This repository is under development. The following scripts are available now.
<br/>

1. plot_capped_prisms/ - find capped-prism environments in bi-layered compounds. <br><br> Install the required libraries listed in requirements.txt and then type ```python overlay_plot_capped_prisms.py path prism_nums``` to get started. <br> Type ```python overlay_plot_capped_prisms.py -h``` to get an overview of inputs and options.  <br>The path can be either a single .cif file or a directory containing multiple cif files.
sgs.csv contains the Hermannâ€“Mauguin notation and their latex formatting. Extend this list as required.
colors.csv contains the assigned color-group for each element. Extend this list as required.

$:~/16_plot_custom$ python overlay_plot_capped_prisms.py -h
usage: overlay_plot_capped_prisms.py [-h] [-p] [-f] [-m] [-w] [-s] [-i] [-l] path

Script to plot capped-prisms in bi-layered compounds.

positional arguments:
  path                 path to CIF or folder containing multiple CIFs

options:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  -p , --prisms        set the numbers for prisms (3 for trigonal, 4 for square, 5 for pentagonal, etc.) eg. 3,4 (default)
  -f , --fix_length    fix the length of shortest side
  -m , --marker_size   set marker size eg. 1
  -w , --line_width    set line width eg. 3.0
  -s , --sites         select sites to plot eg. Si1 Al1
  -i, --invert         invert the layers
  -l, --label          label the sites

Output images will be (over)written inside images folder in the current directory. CIFs encountering errors will be written to errors.txt```
<br>
2. inner_CN/ finds the inner coordination numbers using the d/d_min method. This code can run in parallel and the output containing filename, center atom, its Wyckoff, neghbor formula will be saved as .csv file.
<br>
<br>
3. linear_groups - finds the linear M-M-M units made of same element.
